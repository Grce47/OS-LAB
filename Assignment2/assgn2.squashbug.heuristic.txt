The heuristic for the squashbug is as follows:

1) We decided to use the child process count because time for each process can vary as per the type of process (high for cpu intensive tasks and low for sleeping malwares).
2) We checked the ratio of total children of a process to total children of its child process as obtained from the parent list of given pid.
3) For the given malware, it is expected that total children of the process increase with time faster as compared to its non malware parent.
4) Hence we check from init (1) process, then go down the tree. The anomaly is denoted a malware.
5) This is repeated a few times for confirmation.


Implementation:

1) We generated the process tree by accessing the /proc/PID/status file to get the pid and ppid details.
2) Then we used DFS to get total count of child process for a given pid.
3) Then we applied the above described heuristic to get the malware process if its fits the criteria else we detect no malware.
